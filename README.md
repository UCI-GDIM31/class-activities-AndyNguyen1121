I learned how to upload games on itch.io that allows people to play immediately. I learned how hierarchies work and that the children always follows the parent's transform position. Components allow for values such as speed and rotation values to be edited individually.

### W2
1. The RGB values are floats because not all colors can be represented with integers. Color values can be decimals, which is why it must be a float.
2. _bounce is an int because the number of bounces can not be represented as a decimal. You can not have 1.5 bounces. The bounces have to be whole numbers.
3. The step 4 error has a missing semicolon at the end of the statement which prevented the game from running.
   
### W3
The function's return type should be void. The function have one parameter for the player's sanity level and use that to change the light brightness accordingly.
